## Mules
- Mules are a very special mix – they have a donkey father and horse mother and they often inherit the best qualities of both.
- Mules can be faster than donkeys and more intelligent than horses and live a very long life. Mules born from a donkey mother and horse father are known as hinnys and tend not to be as strong as mules.

## Ponies
- Ponies are horses, just a shorter variety. A fully grown pony will be below 1.44 metres at the highest part of its back.  
- Ponies are typically very strong and can be gentle – therefore many are used to help children learn to ride.
